      🌌 A Glimpse Beyond the Blue — Humanity’s Journey into Space
    </h1>

    <p>
      Since the beginning of time, humans have looked up at the night sky and wondered what lies beyond.
      The stars have guided travelers, inspired stories, and made us dream of other worlds.
      For thousands of years, space was a mystery — unreachable and unknown. 
      But in the 20th century, we finally took our first real step into the cosmos.
    </p>

    <h2 class=" mt-10 mb-3 text-white">🚀 The Dawn of Space Exploration</h2>

    <p>
      Everything changed in <strong>1957</strong> when the Soviet Union launched <strong>Sputnik 1</strong>, 
      the first artificial satellite. It was just a small metal sphere that beeped from orbit — 
      but it marked the beginning of the space age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came <strong>Yuri Gagarin</strong> in 1961, the first human to travel into space. His words still echo through history:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-400 pl-4 italic my-3">“I see Earth! It is so beautiful.”</blockquote>
    <p>
      Not long after, the United States made history with the <strong>Apollo 11 mission</strong> in 1969.
      When <strong>Neil Armstrong</strong> stepped onto the Moon, humanity didn’t just conquer distance — 
      we proved that dreams could become reality.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-yellow-400 pl-4 italic">“One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”</blockquote>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">🌠 Voyagers to the Unknown</h2>

    <p>
      While astronauts explored nearby space, our robots went farther. 
      In 1977, NASA launched <strong>Voyager 1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> — twin spacecraft designed to explore the outer planets. 
      They showed us the true beauty of <strong>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,</strong> and <strong>Neptune</strong> — 
      planets we had only seen as distant dots before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voyager 1 is now the farthest human-made object from Earth. It carries a <strong>Golden Record</strong> — 
      filled with sounds, greetings, and music from our planet. 
      Think of it as a time capsule, drifting through interstellar space, carrying a message of who we are.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">🌍 From Competition to Cooperation</h2>

    <p>
      In the beginning, space exploration was a race — the <strong>U.S.</strong> vs. the <strong>Soviet Union</strong>. 
      But over time, something amazing happened: <em>cooperation replaced competition.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>International Space Station (ISS)</strong> became a shining example of teamwork. 
      Astronauts from different countries live and work together in orbit — 
      proving that when it comes to exploring space, humanity is stronger as one.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">🇮🇳 India’s Cosmic Leap — The Chandrayaan Missions</h2>

    <p>
      India entered the space race quietly, but with determination. 
      In <strong>2008</strong>, ISRO’s <strong>Chandrayaan-1</strong> discovered <strong>water molecules on the Moon</strong> — 
      a finding that changed what scientists thought they knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in <strong>2023</strong>, <strong>Chandrayaan-3</strong> made India the first country to land near the Moon’s south pole, 
      and only the fourth country ever to soft-land on the Moon. 
      It was a proud moment — not just for India, but for all of humanity. 
      A reminder that great things come from perseverance and belief.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">🛰️ The New Space Age — Rockets, Startups, and New Dreams</h2>

    <p>
      We’re now living in a <strong>new era of space exploration</strong>. 
      Companies like <strong>SpaceX</strong>, <strong>Blue Origin</strong>, and <strong>Virgin Galactic</strong> 
      are building reusable rockets, launching satellites, and planning space tourism. 
    </p>
    <p>
      NASA’s <strong>Artemis program</strong> aims to send humans back to the Moon soon — 
      and prepare for future missions to <strong>Mars</strong>. 
      What once sounded like science fiction is slowly turning into <em>science fact.</em>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">💫 Why We Explore</h2>

    <p>
      Why do we keep going back to space? Because it’s who we are. 
      Humans are naturally curious — we’ve always wanted to see what’s beyond the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astronauts often talk about something called the <strong>“Overview Effect.”</strong> 
      It’s the moment when they see Earth from space — small, blue, and fragile — 
      and realize that we all share this one tiny home.
    </p>
    <p>
      From up there, there are no borders, no divisions — just one planet, one people.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">🌎 Space Helps Earth Too</h2>

    <p>Exploring space isn’t just about leaving Earth — it also helps us here:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>Satellites track weather, climate, and pollution.</li>
      <li>GPS systems help us travel safely.</li>
      <li>Space research has led to better materials, medicines, and technology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every rocket launch brings back knowledge and innovation to improve life on Earth.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">🧭 The Road Ahead</h2>

    <p>The future of space looks bright and exciting:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>Humans will return to the Moon soon.</li>
      <li>We may step on Mars in the coming decades.</li>
      <li>Telescopes like <strong>James Webb</strong> are peering deep into the universe’s past.</li>
      <li>More nations, including India, are joining the cosmic journey.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But we must explore wisely — protecting planets from contamination, 
      managing space debris, and ensuring that space remains open and peaceful for everyone.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-white">❤️ A Final Thought — Beyond the Horizon</h2>

    <p>
      Our journey into space is more than rockets and technology — 
      it’s about <strong>who we are</strong> and what we can become when we dream together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars remind us that curiosity is humanity’s greatest strength.
      We don’t explore space to escape Earth — we explore to understand it better, 
      and to see how small, beautiful, and connected we really are.
    </p>
